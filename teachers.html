					<p> I have been a substitute teacher for the past eleven years for pre-school through high school. Most of my experience has been teaching in small rural schools or private Christian schools.  I completed my Bachelor of Education at EWU with a major in math and a minor in special education. I also earned my Masters of Education at EWU. </p>

				    <p> I have been married for 27 years. We have four children, ages 20-26, and a 2 year old granddaughter. I am active at Sprague Community Church in children and women's ministries. I enjoy reading, cross stitching, and walking. </p>

				    <p> I am excited for the kindergarteners as they begin to read and write. It is a blessing to be in a school where these students also learn about God’s truths and hide His Word in their hearts.  We also enjoy time for crafts, recreation, and music. I look forward to teaching the kindergarten class. </p>

					<p> Hi, my name is Jennifer Mulcahy.  My husband, Fred and I have four children ranging in age from 7 to 20 years old. We live outside Spokane and love the outdoors and wildlife. My relationship with the Lord and my family are most important to me. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, stamping, and being crafty. </p>

					<p>I graduated from Eastern Washington University in 1993 with a BA in Education. I majored in reading with a minor in math. I have been with CCA since it began in 2000. It has been fun to watch it grow over the years. At CCA I have taught at different levels ranging from 3rd grade to 6th grade. I love the students here and have watched many of them grow into amazing adults. It is so exciting to look forward to what God has in store for CCA and these students.</p>

					<p>Cornerstone has a special place in my heart. God has blessed me and my family by allowing me and my children to be a part of such a special school.  </p>
